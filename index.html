          <p> Originally mazes were reffered to as labyrinths because they had one path way and had been used for spiritual journeys. 2,521 Years ago is said to be when the first "maze" was built in Egypt. This comes from 5th century b.c.; the greek historian Herodotus, wrote that "This I have actually seen, a work beyound words. For if anyone put together the buildings of the greeks and display of their labours, they would seem lesser in both effort and expense to this labrinth...Even the pyramids are beyound words, and each was equal to many and mighty works of the greeks. Yet the labyrinth surpasses even the pyramids." Herodotus also said it was a very winding building made up of thousands of rooms many of which were underground and held Egyptian Kings. The only maze that is said to come close is the fabled Cretan Labyrinth that was said to house the fearsome Minatour. However the term maze didn't come around till the 13th century meaning delirium or delusion. However it wouldn't be till 16th century when mazes were used for entertainment for European Royalty.Other labyrinths have been found in ruins of northern European cultures—it is believed that Nordic fisherman, for instance, might have walked labyrinths before heading out to sea as a way of ensuring a plentiful haul and safe return. In Germany, young men would walk through labyrinths as they approached adulthood.<p>

After the fall of the Roman Empire, most labyrinths took on a decidedly religious nature. No longer were they three-dimensional walled structures; instead, they could be found painted on the floors and walls of religious enclaves. The meaning of these labyrinths remains mysterious, though several theories exist. Some believe that the winding path was meant to symbolize the difficult life of an early Christian. Others feel that the labyrinths were meant to depict the entangling nature of sin. Still others believe that the labyrinths were used to create a sort of "mini-pilgrimage" that a parishioner would take if they committed a small sin. <p>

During the Middle Ages, labyrinths evolved from spiritual journeys to amusing pastimes. As kings and queens built up elaborate gardens, they would often include some sort of hedge maze as a diversion for themselves and guests. Mazes have retained their close relationship with gardens ever since—today, most public mazes exist in the form of hedge mazes or corn mazes, the latter being a distinctly American invention. England, with its long tradition of gardening, has 125 mazes open to the public. </p>

            <p id="left" > This was the original way that labyrinths were made and used for spiritual journeys; this symbol was craved into many items just as many mazes were originally modeled after. This is a type of stone labyrinth which is used as an opportunity to reconnect to yourself, nature, and your community. It tends to be built in a spot that the creator feels if medatative ground; this means that the spot involkes thought to the person thus helping them on their reconnective journey. The photo of this labyrinth implies they want the person to continue on their journey of walking and pondering, finding themselves even more rather than standing at the center. We can tell this because of how tiny the middle is, since the middle tends to be when you would medatate and reflect more upon yourself we can tell that the creator wanted the walker to continue on their meditative thought journey quicker. </p>

            <p id="right" > Here is the Cretan labyrinth that Daedalus built. From it no one who entered could escape except Theseus, who succeeded through the grace of Ariadne’s thread. This is a drawing of the fable cretan maze that the Minatour was said to reside in. Despite the fact that the Minatour was so feared the Romans used this symbol in their daily lives. It was said to be a symbol of fortification and protection; so they would hang, draw, or crave the maze into their homes, business, etc.. to add that protection and fortification so it may never fall.  </p>

            <p id="left" > Following a Chartres-type design, the labyrinth found in the Cathedral of San Maritino in Lucca, Italy was cut into a single stone and acts as bas-relief. Located within the porch at the western end of the cathedral, the labyrinth has been placed vertically into one of the pillars.Similar to other Italian labyrinths, the one from Lucca draws parallels between the pagan Theseus and Christ. As the hexameter points out, one cannot succeed without Ariadne’s thread. Therefore, the faithful must rely on God to lead them out. According to the observations of Julien Durand, this labyrinth once contained the images of Theseus and the Minotaur, but over hundreds of years, the fingers of thousands have gradually rubbed these characters out, so that today no trace of them remains.</p>

        <p>A vast palace complex located on the shores of a lake seven days journey up the Nile from the pyramids, the Labyrinth was built by pharaoh Amenemhet III in the 19th century BC. It consisted of thousands of rooms and twelve large maze-like courtyards, which were probably intended to keep out unwelcome visitors. Amenemhet was fascinated by mazes, and he also created a fantastic life-size maze inside his nearby pyramid to thwart tomb robbers. Mazes have an ancient history spanning thousands of years—though the first mazes weren't mazes at all, but labyrinths, with a single winding path not meant to confuse or puzzle the way we think of traditional mazes. Labyrinths were first designed as spiritual journeys to guide the visitor along a single path, twisting yet serene. The first recorded labyrinth comes from Egypt in the 5th century B.C. </p>

        <p> Sitting just outside the modern city of Heraklion on the island of Crete, Knossos has been called Europe’s oldest city, with humans present since 7000BCE (BC)!

Knossos was one of the principal centers of the Minoan civilization, whose rise coincided with the beginnings of the Greek Bronze Age around 3000BCE (BC). But it was only around 1900BCE (BC) that the Minoans started to build their palaces, and it’s from this earliest point that the first palace complex at Knossos dates.

By 1700BC, Earthquakes were thought to have destroyed much of the original construction, and so the palace was built again on a much grander scale. Financed by lucrative

Mediterranean trade, the palace complex grew to cover five acres of multi-story buildings including luxurious royal apartments, various living quarters, and storage areas, all serviced by plumbing. </p>

        <p> Mogor, Galicia, NW Spain
early Bronze Age, c. 2000 BCE? A lmaze carved on a rockface several hundred years ago can look no different from an example carved thousands of years ago. Other examples, found on objects recovered in archaeological excavations, can sometimes be securely dated, but despite these problems, we know that the earliest labyrinths to be found in Europe are possibly around 4000 years old. labyrinths started to appear as a feature in churches as Christianity spread across Europe. These church labyrinths were not three-imensional, but appeared as art painted on walls or inlaid on the floor. The purpose of these labyrinths is a matter of conjecture. Some authorities hold that they represent difficulties and intricacies that beset a Christian during his life. Another view is that they are a symbol of the entangling nature of sin.  </p>
