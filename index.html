            <h2>MMDXXI</h2>
            <p> Originally mazes were reffered to as labyrinths because they had one path way and had been used for spiritual journeys. 2,521 Years ago is said to be when the first "maze" was built in Egypt. This comes from 5th century b.c.; the greek historian Herodotus, wrote that "This I have actually seen, a work beyound words. For if anyone put together the buildings of the greeks and display of their labours, they would seem lesser in both effort and expense to this labrinth...Even the pyramids are beyound words, and each was equal to many and mighty works of the greeks. Yet the labyrinth surpasses even the pyramids." Herodotus also said it was a very winding building made up of thousands of rooms many of which were underground and held Egyptian Kings. The only maze that is said to come close is the fabled Cretan Labyrinth that was said to house the fearsome Minatour. However the term maze didn't come around till the 13th century meaning delirium or delusion. However it wouldn't be till 16th century when mazes were used for entertainment for European Royalty. </p>

              <p> This was the original way that labyrinths were made and used for spiritual journeys; this symbol was craved into many items just as many mazes were originally modeled after. This is a type of stone labyrinth which is used as an opportunity to reconnect to yourself, nature, and your community. It tends to be built in a spot that the creator feels if medatative ground; this means that the spot involkes thought to the person thus helping them on their reconnective journey. The photo of this labyrinth implies they want the person to continue on their journey of walking and pondering, finding themselves even more rather than standing at the center. We can tell this because of how tiny the middle is, since the middle tends to be when you would medatate and reflect more upon yourself we can tell that the creator wanted the walker to continue on their meditative thought journey quicker. </p>

              <p> Here is the Cretan labyrinth that Daedalus built. From it no one who entered could escape except Theseus, who succeeded through the grace of Ariadne’s thread. This is a drawing of the fable cretan maze that the Minatour was said to reside in. Despite the fact that the Minatour was so feared the Romans used this symbol in their daily lives. It was said to be a symbol of fortification and protection; so they would hang, draw, or crave the maze into their homes, business, etc.. to add that protection and fortification so it may never fall.  </p>

              <p> Following a Chartres-type design, the labyrinth found in the Cathedral of San Maritino in Lucca, Italy was cut into a single stone and acts as bas-relief. Located within the porch at the western end of the cathedral, the labyrinth has been placed vertically into one of the pillars.Similar to other Italian labyrinths, the one from Lucca draws parallels between the pagan Theseus and Christ. As the hexameter points out, one cannot succeed without Ariadne’s thread. Therefore, the faithful must rely on God to lead them out. According to the observations of Julien Durand, this labyrinth once contained the images of Theseus and the Minotaur, but over hundreds of years, the fingers of thousands have gradually rubbed these characters out, so that today no trace of them remains.</p>
